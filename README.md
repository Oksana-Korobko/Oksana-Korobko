## Hello friends!

I am currently looking for a new job as a front-end development. I worked as a computer science teacher. I am passionate about creating websites, programming, and graphic design. Took courses from Astound Commerce on JavaScript and from Hillel on front-end development. I know HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, JavaScript, React, SQL. I understand algorithms well, I like challenges and I am not afraid of changes.
